"""Degree transpose: move the active track by degrees of its scale, as stock moves it by semitones.

    python scripts/build_degreetranspose.py [--out PATH]

Stock 1.11 transposes the active track in semitones with [FUNC] + [+]/[-] or
[TRK] + [+]/[-]. In C major, C E G up 2 plays D F# A. This build adds the same
move in degrees of the track's KEYBOARD SETUP scale and root: C E G up 1 degree
plays D F A.

- [KEYBOARD] + [FUNC] + [+]/[-], or [KEYBOARD] + [TRK] + [+]/[-]: the active
  track, one degree a press.
- [KEYBOARD] + [TRK] + [FUNC] + [+]/[-]: stock's octave transpose of the track,
  changing the semitone amount by 12, as without [KEYBOARD].

As with stock's transpose, the degree amount is pending while the keys are held,
blinking where stock shows its own, and takes effect when [FUNC], [TRK] or
[KEYBOARD] is released. [PTN] with [KEYBOARD] held, and every key without
[KEYBOARD] held, works as stock.

## The rule

At each note, the track's degrees give `k`. With `k = 0` the note is stock's.
Otherwise the recorded, live or arp note moves `k` degrees by
`build_scale_degrees.degree_move`, the rule of ARP OFS IN SCALE: a note outside
the scale first moves to the nearest note in it (the lower one on a tie), and
octaves carry by the scale's length. Stock's transposes, in semitones, are added
after. A track with no scale (CHROMATIC, or MODE CHORD MEMORY) moves `k`
semitones, the chromatic scale's degrees. The notes in the pattern are never
rewritten, so `k = 0` plays them as recorded.

## Where the note gets its pitch

The frame ISR (`0x40025e36`) plays each entry of a voice record (a trig's notes,
a live key's, the arp's step, `docs/layer-midi.md`) in one loop. At `0x40026980`
it reads the entry's note into `%d0` and adds the track's transpose
(`0x80005381 + track`) and, when PTN TRANSPOSE CONFIG selects the track, the
pattern's (`0x80005380`), into `%d2`. `0x400269a4` checks `%d2` is 0..127. Then
the voice is allocated by `%d0`, the note as recorded (`0x400269e2`), and `%d2`
goes to the DSP as the pitch (`0x400269b8`). So releases find their voice
whatever `%d2` was, which is why stock's transposes are added only to `%d2`, and
why this build changes only `%d2`.

The hook replaces the range check's first 6 bytes (`0x400269a4`; layermidi hooks
`0x40026980`). The voice record is `-36(%fp)`, as for the arp step, so
`build_scale_degrees.locate` finds the track's part of the playing pattern, which
holds the amount, and `build_scale_degrees.resolve` the track's scale and root. A
layered copy (TRACK WILL TRIGGER, `0x400255b4`) is voiced here for its
destination track (`+16`) and moves by that track's degrees, as stock adds that
track's transpose; `locate` finds the pattern through its source track (`+92`),
whose playback copy the copy keeps in `+44`.

## A MIDI track's notes

A MIDI track's notes are not voiced: the sequencer (`0x400d8b5a`, for the tracks
in the kit's mask `+0x5cda`) and the live keys (`0x4012b8b0`) build MIDI
records, and the MIDI task (`0x4012a9a8`) sends them. Its note-on adds stock's
transposes from its own copies, set with the pattern: `0x4012b16e` takes the
entry's note (`%a3 +2`), adds the track's (`0x4461723c + 4 * track`) and, when
its PTN TRANSPOSE CONFIG copy (`0x44617234`) selects the track, the pattern's
(`0x44617238`), and `0x4012b1b0` checks 0..127. A live key's release
(`0x4012b362..0x4012b37c`) works out the note to turn off the same way, so a
transpose changed while the key is held leaves the old note on (stock does this
with its semitones; checked in the emulator).

The hooks replace both range checks' first 6 bytes, and `midi_degrees` moves the
note as the synth's is moved. A MIDI record's track is its `+8`; its `+44`
can be another track's playback copy (a layered note keeps its source's), so
the track's amount, scale and root are read from the current playback copy
(`0x42c5a9a0`) by the track, as stock keeps its MIDI transposes per track.

## The keys: pending while held, applied on release

The main screen's key handler (`0x4005ed12`, the view in `%a2`, the key event in
`%d2`: its key code at `+12`, and at `+16` flags whose bit 0 is set while the key
is pressed and bit 1 when [FUNC] came with it) dispatches on the key code. Stock's
transposes are pending in the view: [TRK] or [FUNC] pressed copies the track's
applied amount to `+536`; [+] (52) and [-] (54), at `0x4005fb62`, set the flag
`+545` and add 1 (12 with [FUNC] for an octave) through `0x4011f7e4(code)`, "is
that key held": [PTN] (23) held moves the pattern instead, else [TRK] (16) held or
[FUNC] with the key the track (`0x4005fbd0`); the release of [FUNC] (`0x4006067c`)
applies the amount and clears the flag.

This build keeps its own pending amount, a flag and a value with the track it is
for, in its code chunk:

- `0x4005fb76`, after [+]/[-]'s key code is read: with [KEYBOARD] (18) held and
  [TRK] held or [FUNC] with the key (stock's order), the key starts the pending
  amount from the applied one if none is pending, adds 1 or -1 within
  MAX_DEGREES, and leaves through stock's redraw (`0x4005fc24`), which marks the
  key used (`0x4005ef52`). Every other combination goes to stock: [KEYBOARD] not
  held, [PTN] held, [TRK] and [FUNC] together (the octave), or neither [TRK] nor
  [FUNC]. Stock's pending amounts are untouched.
- `0x4005ed2c`, at the head of the handler, after any key's code is read: the
  release of [FUNC], [TRK] or [KEYBOARD] applies the pending amount, then stock
  handles the key as before.

The active track is `0x40046bfe(*(view +152) + 48)`, as stock's own transpose
finds it (`0x4003efde`). The amount is read and written through the current
pattern's objects, as stock's transposes are: `0x4003efa8(project)` is the
pattern's and `0x4003b2ea(pattern, track)` a track's, and each object's vtable
`+40` gives its part of the pattern in RAM. After writing, this build calls the
stock setter of the same byte with the stock bits as they are, so the change is
announced as stock's own edits are.

## The display

Stock draws its two transposes in `0x4005c9f8(view, canvas, x, y)`: the
pattern's on the title bar, then, from `0x4005ca66`, the track's in the header of
the track box, where SYN is, cleared (`0x40114842(canvas, 1, 43, 13, 49, 0)`),
drawn as `%+d` in the small font (`0x44507eb8`) centred on x 7 (flags 2) and
inverted (mode -1). A pending amount is drawn only while the view's `+548` is 1;
a timer (`0x4005bcf6`) flips `+548` while a pending flag is set, and redraws,
which is the blink.

- `0x4005ca66`, where the track's part begins: this build draws the track box
  itself, then leaves through the routine's epilogue (`0x4005cb4a`). It shows, in
  order: stock's pending amount (blinking); this build's (blinking, with the
  degree mark); else the applied amounts, the degrees with the mark and the
  semitones as stock. A box that has both alternates between them, each shown
  for ALTERNATE_TICKS ticks of the timer.
- `0x4005beb6`, in the timer: this build's pending flag blinks as stock's do, and
  while the box alternates, every ALTERNATE_TICKS ticks it redraws.

## Where the amount lives

In the pattern, as stock's transpose is: each track of each pattern of each
project keeps its own, saved, loaded, copied and cleared with it. It is a signed
4-bit field in bits 2..5 of the track's byte `+1187` in RAM, bits stock's
converters drop. Its bits 0..1 are a stock setting (0..3; getter `0x40050430`,
setter `0x40050460`). Stored, the byte is the track's `+1176`, whose bit 7 is a
flag (`+1176` in RAM).

- Stock's load keeps bits 0..1 (`0x400de1ec`) and its save writes them back with
  bit 7, clearing bits 2..6 (`0x400de28c`). This build widens both masks to bits
  0..5.
- The getter masks the stock setting, and the setter keeps the degrees.
- The track default (`0x400e75a4`), which clearing a track or a pattern runs,
  keeps them, as it keeps the semitone transpose (`+1156`); stock's reset of that
  transpose (`0x400e7408`) resets them.

The range is MAX_DEGREES: 7 degrees reach every note of the longest scale (8
notes) up or down, and anything further is an octave, which stock's octave
gesture moves. Bit 6 stays unused.

The instrument's own saves leave these bits at 0: in a +Drive backup of seven
projects (2026-10-12), every track record that loads (version 2 or 3) has
`+1176` bits 2..6 clear. So a project saved before this build opens with no
degrees. Stock firmware, given a stored track byte with degrees in it, as this
build saves it (`scripts/emu_degreetranspose.py`'s `reload`), keeps bits 0..1
and plays the notes as recorded; its next save of that pattern writes bits 2..5
as 0, so the degrees are gone (`stock-load`).

The pending amount lives in the code chunk and is not saved.

## Code and RAM

One platform `CODE` chunk at `0x467b8000`, in the free run between lfolength's
code (`0x467b0000`, 260 B) and arpplocks (`0x467c0000`) (`docs/mod-memory-regions.md`).
Its pending state lives at the chunk's end.
