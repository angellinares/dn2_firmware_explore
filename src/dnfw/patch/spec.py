"""What a patch record is, and what makes one valid.

The shape is adapted from `PATCHES` / `patchlib.py` in bryantysinger/octa-bt-pt
(MIT), which patches the same CPU family: declarative records carrying the
bytes they expect to find, so a patch refuses to apply to firmware it was not
written against.

Two deliberate differences. That project guards on a single `STOCK_SHA256` of
the whole image; here a patch names the **device, build and version** it
targets as well, so a patch that does not apply says which of those disagreed
instead of only that a hash did not match. And every patch carries `expect` --
the bytes it is replacing -- which is checked at the target before anything is
written. A hash guard alone cannot catch a patch pointed at the wrong offset
inside the right image.

Only same-length replacement is supported. Anything that changes a section's
length moves every address after it, and nothing here can fix up the code that
refers to them. Growing the firmware is a code-cave problem, which is Phase 2.
