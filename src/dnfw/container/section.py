"""One ELE3 section: the 8-byte header in front of a compressed stream, and
the question of whether a section is compressed at all.

    [u32 stream length BE][u32 sum of the stream bytes BE][stream ...]

Not every section has this. On both Digitones `meta`, `updater` and `boot` --
and DN1's `blob` -- are stored raw, and the only reliable test is whether the
bytes depack. So a section is modelled as its **stored** bytes, exactly as they
sit in the container, and compression is something we discover rather than
assume. `dnfw build` must never recompress a section it could not depack.

**A compressed section is zero-padded to a multiple of four bytes.** The header
still gives the exact stream length and the sum of the stream alone; the
padding sits after the stream and is counted only in the section table's
length. Every compressed section of Digitone II OS 1.10D, 1.10E and 1.11 --
eleven of them -- follows this, with 0 to 3 bytes of padding each. Images
built without it boot through the normal update path and stall in recovery,
so it is written here rather than left to chance. See `docs/flashing.md`.
